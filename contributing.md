# Contributing to Alien-Hack
Before you even begin, you have to contact Doigt by direct message on Discord. You can find him in the [D Language Code Club](https://discord.gg/bMZk9Q4). Random PRs from people we don't know will be ignored. The only exception to this is if you find and fix a security vulnerability, in which case, your PR's title must begin with \[Security Fix].

## Rules
1. Don't deviate from our style conventions.
2. Don't directly edit main; create a new branch and make a PR once the changes are ready.
3. Rule 2 doesn't apply if you forked the project.
4. No merge without a code review from someone other than the author of the PR.
5. Rule 4 doesn't apply to Doigt if the changes are only text documents.

## Style Conventions
We mostly follow the official D style conventions which can be read [here](https://dlang.org/dstyle.html).
